          Welcome, welcome, welcome to “Last Week Tonight!” I’m John Oliver,
          thanks for joining us. It’s been a busy week. Biden met with Xi
          Jinping, King Charles celebrated his 75th birthday while looking at
          least 97, and George Santos announced he wouldn’t be seeking
          re-election after an ethics committee report he disputes found — among
          other things — he’d used campaign donations for personal purchases on
          botox, Sephora, and OnlyFans. And honestly? I like him now, and I
          think he should stay. Meanwhile, Israel’s airstrikes and ground
          invasion continued in Gaza, and the discourse on it here reached its
          absolute nadir when Fox Business welcomed Fabio for a 10-minute
          interview on the subject, including this wild digression concerning
          Hamas.
